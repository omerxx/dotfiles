# takopi-dotfiles

Local Takopi plugins used by `~/dotfiles`.

Currently provides:

- `/finish` — cancel the in-flight run (if any) and kick off the OpenCode completion workflow (PR → merge → cleanup).
- `/o` — start a fresh worktree run (like the local `o` wrapper) and keep the worktree for follow-ups.
