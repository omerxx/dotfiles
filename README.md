## Installation

### Using GNU Stow

To symlink these dotfiles to their appropriate locations, use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/):

```sh
stow .
```
This command will create symlinks from the files in this repository to their corresponding locations in your home directory.

### Homebrew Packages

If you're using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for package management, you can export your installed packages before leaving a machine and reinstall them on a new one:

```sh
# Export installed packages
brew leaves > leaves.txt

# Install packages on a new machine
xargs brew install < leaves.txt
```

This will save a list of your installed packages to `leaves.txt` and then reinstall them on a new machine.

## Additional Setup

Some configurations may require additional setup or dependencies. Please refer to the individual directories and their respective configuration files for more details.

Feel free to explore and modify these configurations to suit your needs. Enjoy your personalized setup!
